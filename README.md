# Windows 11 Registry Tweaks

Currently this Repository only features a tweak for the context menu's. I might add more tweaks later.

This program provides an easy method for Windows 11 users to switch between the old (legacy) and new context menus.

## Features
- Toggle between the old and new context menus with a simple command.
- Written in C for lightweight and direct system operations.
- Provides instructions for manually restarting the Windows shell if needed.

## Usage
1. Download the latest `contextMenu.zip` from the [Releases](https://github.com/MikeCVermeer/Windows-11-Tweaks/releases) section.
2. Navigate to the directory where you saved the `contextMenu.zip`.
3. Navigate into the contextMenu.zip folder, then run the executable: `contextMenu.exe`
4. Choose between enabling the old context menu, disabling it, or exiting the program.
5. If the Windows shell doesn't restart automatically, follow the on-screen instructions to manually restart it.

## Why use this?

With the advent of Windows 11, Microsoft introduced a new context menu design. Some users prefer the older style, and this program offers a simple way to switch between the two.
